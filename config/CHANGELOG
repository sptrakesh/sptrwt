2007/11/21 - Version 1.3
- Modified Table and View meta data view components to display
  the total number of records in the selected object.  Clicking
	on the number displays a table data viewer component that
	can be used to walk through all the rows in the table.  Clicking
	on the table header columns will sort the data by the selected
	column.  (Tested only with PostgreSQL and Oracle).
- Implemented user configurable limitation on the maximum characters
  displayed as results of query execution.  User can now use the
	"Column Length" text field in Query Executor and Batch Query
	Executor to control the amount of data displayed in screen.

2007/11/09 - Version 1.2
- Added support for Oracle data dictionary as Oracle does not
  support information_schema.
- Implemented pagination of results from Batch Query Executor.
- Added Export to Excel feature in Batch Query Executor.

2007/10/30 - Version 1.1.2
- Fixed ClassCastException in com.sptci.rwt.webui.SaveQueryListener
  introduced after refactoring out ExecutorView as base class
	of QueryExecutorView and BatchQueryExecutorView.
	Thanks to Andrew Stevens <androostevens@yahoo.com> for reporting
	the bug and the fix for it.

2007/10/28 - Version 1.1
